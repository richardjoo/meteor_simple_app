This is just one step more advanced than the absolutely the basic meteor app.

1. first, add coffeescript to this app. 
    * meteor add coffeescript
2. renamed meteor_simple_app.js to meteor_simple_app.coffee
3. change meteor_simple_app.html file
4. add some stuff to coffeescript

This is very similar from the railscasts I followed.
It is nothing but to see how the meteor works.
You are more than welcome to get this and check it out.
